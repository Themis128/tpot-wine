Here’s a README.md specifically for validate_models.py, explaining its purpose, usage, and configuration:

# Wine Quality Model Validator

`validate_models.py` is a utility script used to **evaluate and benchmark TPOT-generated models** for predicting wine quality across different regions.

## Features

- Automatically loads all `.joblib` models from the `models/` directory.
- Looks for corresponding processed datasets in `data/processed_filled/`.
- Runs classification or regression evaluation based on target type.
- Appends performance metrics (e.g., accuracy or R²) to a centralized leaderboard.
- Logs detailed validation output for traceability.
- Skips models with missing or misnamed datasets and logs warnings.

## Directory Structure

tpot-wine/ ├── data/ │   └── processed_filled/ │       └── combined_<Region>filled.csv ├── models/ │   └── combined<Region>filled<timestamp>.joblib ├── logs/ │   └── leaderboard.csv │   └── validation_<timestamp>.log ├── scripts/ │   └── validate_models.py

---

## Usage

### From root directory:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
python -m scripts.validate_models

Sample Output:

▶ Validating models...
✅    Leaderboard updated.

All valid results will be logged to:

logs/leaderboard.csv (summary)

logs/validation_<timestamp>.log (detailed log)



---

Naming Convention for Models

To ensure successful validation, model files must follow this pattern:

combined_<Region>_filled_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.joblib

Corresponding datasets should follow:

combined_<Region>_filled.csv


---

Dependencies

pandas

scikit-learn

joblib

logging


Install with:

pip install -r requirements.txt


---

Troubleshooting

If no valid results appear, ensure model filenames match the expected pattern.

Check if dataset files exist for each region.

Review logs under /logs/ for errors or missing files.
