Hereâ€™s a tailored README_predict.md for your predict.py script:


---

Wine Quality Prediction Script

This script performs predictions using trained TPOT models on preprocessed wine quality datasets, and outputs both CSV files and PDF reports summarizing the results.


---

Usage

PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m scripts.predict --region REGION_NAME [--verbose]


---

Arguments


---

Behavior

Loads model from: models/combined_<REGION>_filled_<TIMESTAMP>.joblib

Reads data from: data/processed_filled/combined_<REGION>_filled.csv

Runs predictions and saves:

CSV: models/<REGION>_predictions_<TIMESTAMP>.csv

PDF report: models/<REGION>_predict_report_<TIMESTAMP>.pdf


Logs stored in: logs/predict_<TIMESTAMP>.log



---

Dependencies

Ensure all required packages are installed via:

pip install -r requirements.txt


---

Notes

utils.py contains shared preprocessing and report generation utilities.

Use PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) to ensure module imports work correctly.

Make sure models and data are named using the expected format.
